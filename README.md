# Gamenite 

**currently in development*

Gamenite is a application to create and manage [board] game groups, their game inventories, as well as schedule and run events. 

Users can create game groups, join other groups, and invite others to their groups. The games manager section will eventually leverage the BoardGameGeeks API, but is currently set up to store games locally in the db. The events component allows groups to create event at a specific date time, and for players to be able to nominate and vote on games which will be played during that session based on constraints like number of players or approximate game duration. 

Built with the PERN stack. The app uses auth0 for account creation and login.
